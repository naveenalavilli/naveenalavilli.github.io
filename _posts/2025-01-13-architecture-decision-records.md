ADRs are only useful if they stay readable and explain *why* the decision was made.

A small ADR template I like:

1. **Context**: the problem, constraints, and time pressure.
2. **Decision**: the final call in one sentence.
3. **Options considered**: 2-4 alternatives with trade-offs.
4. **Consequences**: what becomes easier, harder, or more expensive.

Two practices make ADRs resilient:

- Keep them short and focused. One ADR per decision.
- Link to follow-up ADRs when the decision changes.

You should be able to scan an ADR in one minute and answer, "does this still hold?"
